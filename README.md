Decrypts a file with XE encrypted contents.  HackThisSite realistic/6 is provided in the example. Written in Java.   

1) Replace the contents of file "encrypted" with your XEencoded text
2) run XEDecrypt.java
3) decrypted message will output to console

I'm too lazy to create some kind of jar or w/e, I'm more interested in the code and actual decryption algorithm, feel free to enhance.
